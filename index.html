              <h3>Biography</h3>
              Miles Morales is a kid living in Brooklyn. He is first seen heading to his new school. He planned of
              walking there but ends up being with his dad (other students make fun of him due to his dad forced him to
              respond his words while dropping off). He got an essay to about his life while at school. Later after
              school, his uncle Aaron asked him to join painting graffiti on the subway station. After finishing his
              graffiti, Miles ends up getting bitten by a Radioactive Spider, causing him to have spider powers. The
              next morning, he meets a girl who claims to go by ¨Gwanda¨,when he accidentally gets his fingers stuck to
              her hair while trying to talk to her, forcing her to have part of her hair shaved off, which results in
              him being made fun of by others. As he returns to his dorm room, he unintentionally shows New York that he
              has all the same powers and abilities as Spider-Man.
