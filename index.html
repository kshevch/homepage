              <h3>Biography</h3>
              <p>
                Miles Morales is a kid living in Brooklyn. He is first seen heading to his new school. He planned of
                walking there but ends up being with his dad (other students make fun of him due to his dad forced him
                to
                respond his words while dropping off). He got an essay to about his life while at school. Later after
                school, his uncle Aaron asked him to join painting graffiti on the subway station. After finishing his
                graffiti, Miles ends up getting bitten by a Radioactive Spider, causing him to have spider powers. The
                next morning, he meets a girl who claims to go by ¨Gwanda¨,when he accidentally gets his fingers stuck
                to
                her hair while trying to talk to her, forcing her to have part of her hair shaved off, which results in
                him being made fun of by others. As he returns to his dorm room, he unintentionally shows New York that
                he
                has all the same powers and abilities as Spider-Man.

                <summary>The Death of Spider-Man</summary>
                <p>Kingpin is trying to use his collider to bring back his family, but in doing so, is destroying the
                  universe. There to stop him is Spider-Man, who fights off Kingpin's henchmen/villains, Green Goblin
                  and
                  Prowler. Finding that Miles is like him, Spider-Man offers to train him if he sticks around, but
                  Spider-Man is later badly beaten by the Goblin, who collapses part of the collider on the two of them,
                  trapping Spider-Man. Miles goes to rescue Spider-Man, who tells him not to worry because he always
                  gets
                  back up. He then hands Miles a flash drive which can shut down the particle collider and tells him to
                  do
                  that while he distracts the villains. Miles goes to leave, but then witnesses Kingpin brutally kill
                  Spider-Man out of rage at something he said.</p>

                <p>Horrified and in shock at what he saw, Miles quickly flees with Kingpin sending Prowler after him and
                  returns to his home instead of his dorm room, where he spends in the night. He overhears a news report
                  detailing the death of Spider-Man, whose real name is revealed to be Peter Parker, a 26-year-old grad
                  student married to Mary Jane Parker. News of the death of the beloved Spider-Man spreads throughout
                  New
                  York, and Miles, ridden with guilt, buys a Spider-Man dress-up costume and attends a speech by Mary
                  Jane,
                  where she states that everyone is Spider-Man in the end, which Miles takes to heart, as he has the
                  potential to carry on Peter's legacy.</p>

                <summary>More Than One Wears The Mask</summary>
                <p>Miles finds Peter B. Parker at the grave of Spider-Man. After discovering new powers, and questioning
                  Peter B. Parker, they travel to the advanced technology and research company, Alchemax, in order to
                  download information about Kingpin's collider. Miles, in trying to gather this information, is caught
                  by
                  Olivia Octavius, who works for Alchemax. After temporarily losing the computer, they are saved by Gwen
                  Stacy.</p>

                <p>Gwen takes Miles and Peter to the house of Aunt May, which both Peter and May find difficult as
                  Peter's
                  Aunt May has already passed away and May's nephew of this universe has recently been killed. May leads
                  the three Spider-People to the late Peter Parker's secret bunker, where they are introduced to the
                  universe displaced Spider-Man Noir, Sp//dr, and Spider-Ham. The group decides to put an unwilling
                  Miles's spider abilities to the test, but are disappointed when they find that he has mastered almost
                  none of them, including his unique bioelectric and invisibility abilities. The group then assembles
                  without Miles and formulates a plan to engineer a new flash drive to shut down the collider, with
                  Peter
                  B. Parker volunteering to stay behind to shut down the collider once the others have returned home.
                  Miles is upset by this, stating that he belongs in the universe where they are and that he should be
                  the
                  one to send them all home and shut down the collider so Peter doesn't have to die, but his plan is
                  shot
                  down because he is viewed as an inadequate member of the team, and not yet a competent Spider-Man.</p>

                <p>Pressured and alone, a crestfallen Miles leaves the bunker and visits his Uncle Aaron's apartment,
                  only
                  to find it empty. The window is soon opened by the Prowler, however, causing Miles to hide. Prowler
                  searches the apartment but fails to find his target, as Miles turns invisible out of fear. The Prowler
                  receives a phone call from Fisk, whereupon he unmasks and reveals his identity to be Aaron himself,
                  terrifying the invisible Miles, who flees the apartment noisily. This draws Prowler's attention, who
                  gives chase until the pursuit causes a car accident, allowing Miles to get away.</p>

                <summary>The New Spider-Man</summary>
                <p>Miles returns to the bunker where May is expecting him. Here, he takes one of Peter Parker's old
                  classic suits and spray paints it black, then uses red spray paint to recolor the lens frames and make
                  his own spider logo and designs. Miles then tests out his abilities in the city and, feeling confident
                  that he is ready to become Spider-Man, takes the "leap of faith" that Peter had described to him
                  earlier. Now a competent Spider-Man, Miles travels to the collider and joins in the fight with the
                  other Spiders.</p>

                <p>Miles manages to send all the other Spiders home, with Gwen promising that they would find a way to
                  keep in touch. Miles also encourages Peter to take a leap of faith back in his own universe. Miles
                  then sends Peter home and fights an enraged Fisk throughout the collider. Fisk eventually manages to
                  beat Miles down, but Jefferson Davis, who has arrived and seen the new Spider-Man fighting Fisk,
                  realizes that Spider-Man is not the enemy, but an ally, and encourages him to fight back and beat
                  Fisk. This gives Miles the strength to perform another bioelectric blast, called a venom blast, and
                  incapacitate Fisk. Miles then manages to shut down the collider and end the battle.</p>

                <p>While Fisk is arrested, Jefferson Davis thanks the new Spider-Man for his efforts and wishes him
                  well. Miles, as Spider-Man, goes on to gain the public's approval, becoming New York's new beloved
                  vigilante. Miles also formally introduces himself to his roommate at Visions Academy, including
                  showing him his powers. As Miles prepares to go to sleep one night, a small portal opens and he is
                  greeted by Gwen from her universe.</p>

              <details>
                <summary>Personality</summary>
                <p>Miles is a promising kid with massive potential who just wants to be normal but often does amazing
                  things while trying to avoid the spotlight. When he was accepted into Brooklyn Visions Academy, Miles
                  tries to get himself kicked out by intentionally failing a science test. Miles is a nice and friendly
                  individual, as he enjoys making his friends and family laugh. He also has a habit of making jokes
                  whenever he is in awkward situations as a sort of a tension breaker. Miles has a big interest in
                  hip-hop and graffiti cultures, constantly stamping his art around Brooklyn as a form of
                  self-expression and an expression of love for his city, it seems. </p>
                <p>While initially hesitant to become a superhero like Spider-Man, Miles accepted his role as New York's
                  protector after witnessing Peter Parker's death and being inspired by Mary Jane Parker's speech at
                  Peter's funeral about everyone being Spider-Man in the end. However, despite him already intrinsically
                  knowing his responsibility, Miles found himself struggling to control his abilities due to fear and
                  attempting to mirror Peter Parker's methods of being Spider-Man. Miles eventually comes to realize
                  that he shouldn't be trying to copy Peter, but should instead use his own ideals and deeds as a launch
                  point for his leap of faith. This caused Miles to finally change to his own traditional red and black
                  suit, which is Peter's suit redesigned using the spray paint Miles uses in his graffiti art, making
                  the idea of Spider-Man his own.</p>
                <p>Like the other members of the Spider-Gang, Miles can be very stubborn. When he realized the stakes of
                  the other spiders being in his universe, he was extremely determined to keep his universe's Peter
                  Parker's promise to shut down the collider, despite not being fully experienced. He was also unwilling
                  to let Peter B. Parker stay in his universe to shut down the collider, even going far as to stealing
                  the USB drive and tripping him over, impressing Peter himself.</p>
